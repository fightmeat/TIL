GStreamer is on basically every Ubuntu-based system so this means it is necessary to upgrade GStreamer packages when upgrading FFmpeg.\n","\n","Also, PipeWire 0.3.x packages are copied here from the multimedia PPA due PipeWire now being commonly used by various software. As the FFmpeg 4 PPA is required by numerous PPAs at this Launchpad site it makes the latest PipeWire readily available to all users. PipeWire is built with ALSA 1.2.2 minimum (Focal, backported to Xenial & Bionic) which is then required to run, so base ALSA packages are now also copied here for Xenial & Bionic.\n","\n","* Xenial systems: As of FFmpeg 4.3 the installation requires GCC >= 7 as the Intel-MediaSDK is enabled, with libmfx1 requiring GCC >= 7 (package fails to build with GCC 5.4.0). So GCC 7.5.0 (ppa:savoury1/toolchain) for Xenial has been copied here, making it easier to install FFmpeg 4.x on Xenial (so adding this FFmpeg 4 PPA will bring a few GCC 7.5.0 upgrades).\n","\n","* Focal systems: Builds of FFmpeg are now also available for i386 whereas they were not available initially. Launchpad does not build most packages for i386 architecture for Focal and newer series (Launchpad only builds i386 packages on a whitelist managed by the Launchpad team) including for dav1d and pocketsphinx, so these features are not enabled for Focal i386.\n","\n","*** Build ***\n","\n","This PPA has build dependencies on:\n","\n","  ppa:savoury1/build-tools\n","  ppa:savoury1/backports\n","  ppa:savoury1/fonts\n","  ppa:savoury1/graphics\n","  ppa:savoury1/multimedia\n","\n","Additionally, for Xenial builds only:\n","\n","  ppa:savoury1/perl-xenial\n","\n","*** Credits ***\n","\n","- Creators of FFmpeg: Michael Niedermayer and the entire FFmpeg team\n","  https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/graphs/contributors\n","\n","- Package code: Debian Multimedia Maintainers\n","  https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ffmpeg\n","More info: https://launchpad.net/~savoury1/+archive/ubuntu/ffmpeg4\n","Adding repository.\n","Adding deb entry to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/savoury1-ubuntu-ffmpeg4-jammy.list\n","Adding disabled deb-src entry to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/savoury1-ubuntu-ffmpeg4-jammy.list\n","Adding key to /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/savoury1-ubuntu-ffmpeg4.gpg with fingerprint E996735927E427A733BB653E374C7797FB006459\n","Hit:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Get:2 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates InRelease [119 kB]\n","Get:3 https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64  InRelease [1,581 B]\n","Get:4 https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu jammy-cran40/ InRelease [3,626 B]\n","Get:5 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security InRelease [110 kB]\n","Get:6 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-backports InRelease [109 kB]\n","Get:7 https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64  Packages [515 kB]\n","Hit:8 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/c2d4u.team/c2d4u4.0+/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Get:9 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/main amd64 Packages [1,284 kB]\n","Hit:10 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/deadsnakes/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Get:11 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/restricted amd64 Packages [1,158 kB]\n","Get:12 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/multiverse amd64 Packages [49.9 kB]\n","Get:13 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-updates/universe amd64 Packages [1,263 kB]\n","Hit:14 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/graphics-drivers/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Get:15 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/savoury1/ffmpeg4/ubuntu jammy InRelease [18.1 kB]\n","Get:16 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/universe amd64 Packages [998 kB]\n","Hit:17 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/ubuntugis/ppa/ubuntu jammy InRelease\n","Get:18 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/restricted amd64 Packages [1,137 kB]\n","Get:19 http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu jammy-security/multiverse amd64 Packages [44.0 kB]\n","Get:20 https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/savoury1/ffmpeg4/ubuntu jammy/main amd64 Packages [81.1 kB]\n","Fetched 6,891 kB in 3s (2,170 kB/s)\n","Reading package lists...
